# Listening and Active Communication

## Q1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

1.  Focus fully → keep your mind on the speaker, not your phone or
    random thoughts.\
2.  Don't interrupt → let them finish before you talk.\
3.  Show interest → nod, say "hmm" or "ok" so they feel you care.\
4.  Repeat back / paraphrase → say in your own words what they said, to
    check you got it right.\
5.  Ask questions → if not clear, ask politely.\
6.  Notice feelings → not just words, but how they feel when speaking.\
7.  Give feedback → small responses like "I see" or "that makes sense".

## Q2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

-   Repeat or rephrase what the person said so they know you
    understood.\
-   Check with them if what you understood is correct.\
-   Show empathy → match their feelings, like "I see you are worried" or
    "sounds exciting".\
-   Body language matters → eye contact, nodding, open face.\
-   Goal is clarity → both sides should agree "yes, this is what I
    meant".
