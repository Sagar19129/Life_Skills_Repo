# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits Reflection

**Q1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
The most interesting story for me was about flossing just one tooth. At first it sounds silly, but it makes a big point. When you start very small, it doesn’t feel heavy or difficult. Slowly, one tooth becomes the whole mouth, and the habit grows naturally. This showed me that even big lifestyle changes can begin from one tiny step.

**Q2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?**  
B = MAP means Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt.  
- **M (Motivation):** how much you want to do it.  
- **A (Ability):** how easy or simple it is to do.  
- **P (Prompt):** the reminder or signal that tells you to act.  

To make a new habit easier, we should not depend only on motivation, because motivation goes up and down. Instead, make the habit very easy (increase ability), and connect it with a clear prompt, like “after brushing teeth, I will do one pushup.” This way, it becomes automatic.

**Q3. Why is it important to “Shine” or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**  
Celebration is important because our brain loves positive feelings. When we smile, say “yes,” or feel proud after finishing even a small habit, our brain remembers that happiness. That feeling makes the habit stick and grow faster. It’s not about forcing yourself with willpower, but about connecting good emotions with the new habit. Whatever we celebrate becomes stronger in our life.

**Q4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**  
The most interesting story was about the British cycling team. For many years they were losing, but the new coach focused on making just 1% improvements in many small areas, like seats, pillows, and even handwashing. Slowly these small changes added up, and the team became champions. This showed me how small daily improvements, if done regularly, can create big success over time.

**Q5. What is the book’s perspective about Identity?**  
The book says that habits are built from identity, not just goals. If you only say “I want to quit smoking,” it is weak. But if you say “I am not a smoker,” you are changing who you believe you are. Every small habit is a vote for your identity. Over time, your daily actions prove your identity and make it stronger. This way, you don’t just do a habit—you become the type of person who lives that habit.

**Q6. Write about the book’s perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.**  
The book explains that to make a habit easier, you should reduce friction and follow the “two-minute rule.” That means break the habit down until it takes only two minutes to start. For example, instead of “I will run five kilometers,” say “I will put on my running shoes.” Also, keep tools ready and visible, like placing a guitar in the middle of the room if you want to practice. When a habit feels easy, you are more likely to repeat it every day.

**Q7. Write about the book’s perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.**  
To make a bad habit harder, do the opposite. Make the cue invisible, so you don’t see it. Add friction, so it takes more effort. Make it boring or unattractive, and remove the reward. For example, if I delete a social media app, I will have to reinstall it to waste time, which makes it harder. These small barriers reduce how often the bad habit happens.

**Q8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**  
One habit I want more is reading books daily. To build this habit, I can put the book on my pillow so I see it every night (cue obvious). I will start small, just reading one page (easy). I will choose books that are fun or interesting to me (attractive). After reading, I will smile and feel proud, maybe tick a box in my tracker (satisfying). This way, reading becomes a natural daily routine.

**Q9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**  
One habit I want to reduce is scrolling on my phone at night. To stop this, I will keep my phone outside my bedroom before sleeping (cue invisible). I will change the phone screen to grayscale so it looks boring (unattractive). I will also set a lock code or timer, so it feels like extra effort to use (hard). Finally, I will remind myself of how tired and lazy I feel the next morning after late scrolling (unsatisfying). These steps will help me use my phone less at night.
